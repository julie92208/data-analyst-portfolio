# Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi, I'm Julie!  
I’m a data analyst skilled in **Excel, MySQL, Tableau, and Power BI**.  
This portfolio showcases my analytical projects, dashboards, and SQL solutions.

I’m a former photographer who has always loved learning new skills and creating things from scratch.
I used to spend my days experimenting with lighting setups and editing techniques, and now I channel that same curiosity into data: SQL, Python, dashboard design, and anything that helps me understand the world through numbers.

Self-learning has always been a big part of who I am. Whether it was teaching myself photography, mastering post-production, or now diving deep into data analytics, I enjoy the process of exploring, improving, and building something useful.

Outside of work, I’m usually absorbing new knowledge, organizing things (including spreadsheets!), or recently — getting surprisingly addicted to learning chess.
I love challenges, creative problem-solving, and finding joy in continuous growth.
