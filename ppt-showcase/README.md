# 📊 Presentation Design – PPT Showcase

This folder contains a curated selection of PowerPoint decks I designed for different purposes, including business strategy, data storytelling, product proposals, and training.

The focus of this showcase is to demonstrate my ability to:

- Highlight key messages clearly
- Apply strong visual hierarchy and structure
- Keep slides clean, modern, and easy to scan
- Communicate complex ideas in a simple way
- Design decks that are both professional and visually appealing
